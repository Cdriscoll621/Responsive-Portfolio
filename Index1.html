			<p>I am a 25 year old mother to an amazing 5 year old boy, Noah, who is trying to change my course of life for the better. I was born and raised in Lake Bluff, IL and now currently reside in Ravinia, IL with my boyfriend Mike and our lemon Dalmation, Marley. For the past 2 years I have been working as a Starbucks barista, but recently was offered a position as a front-end web designer at a Chicago based telecommunications company. My life has had its ups and its downs but it is all about the journey and the situations that make us stronger and turn us all into incredible people. Enjoy!</p>
